# Anki Decks

The anki decks that I maintain.


## Homemade vs "Forked"

I should fork any deck here, before beginning to use it. This will make it easier to diff my change as I update the deck for my preferences.


## Diffs

How readable/editable are the diffs? I will get the hang of this as I work with `.apkg` files more frequently.


## Deck Management

I would eventually like to write a deck generator for some common structured data types.

In the meantime, I am going to write some decks by hand to understand the complex features in detail.


## Backup Process

Use the macos anki application installed by `brew cask install anki`.

Export your deck and subdecks as a "Anki Deck Package" or `.apkg` file by selecting the main deck parent.


## Backup Considerations

Backup often, as possible.

- Anki server is free software and can sometimes fail to reconcile and import or export
- It also doesn't track history very well
